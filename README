WiNRADiO toolkit for Linux.
Please read the license and disclaimer in file "COPYING".

This package allows you to use WiNRADiO receivers with Linux. It has
been reported to work with WR-1000i, WR-1500i, WR-3150i, WR-1500e and
WR-1550e devices on various x86 Linux systems.

CONTENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A port of GPL'ed driver source code from WiNRADiO Communications
  (directory driver/wrlib/).


* A user-mode driver (linradio-toolkit-usermode):
    - Very portable, easy installation
    - Must be run as root for internal receivers
    - Slow initialization
    - Does not keep track of the receiver state
    - Not appropriate for transient applications

  
* A loadable kernel module (linradio-toolkit-module):
  Replacement for the user-mode driver, provides:
    - mutual exclusion
    - persistent receiver state
    - no initialization delay
    - non-root operation
    - access control based on file permission.


* A command-line utility to control the radio from shell scripts,
  e.g. wrcontrol -P 0x180 -p 1 -u 0 -a 0 -f 96e6 -m 3


* Tcl bindings for controlling WiNRADiO receivers.

  Documentation is in tcl/man1/tclradio.1. Example:
      # ./tclradio 
      % winradio wr 0x180
      % wr -p 1 -f 15e6 -m AM -a 0 -u 0 -v 50


* Perl bindings for controlling WiNRADiO receivers.

  See perl/winradio.pl and example/ssrecord.pl.
  This is new - please improve.


* A Tcl/Tk graphical control panel.

  Run "wrpanel" (after installing).
  Documentation is in man1/wrpanel.1.


* Miscellaneous sample scripts (directory examples/):
  minipanel.tcl, ssrecord.tcl, sweep.tcl, etc.
