BUILD
-----

Minimum requirements (might work with other versions):
- Linux 2.2.5
- gcc 2.7.2.3
- Tcl 8.0
- Tk 8.0

Run "./configure" to automatically detect include/library paths.
If this fails, you will have to edit ".config" manually.

Choose the module or usermode driver in Makefile.defs.
Set the default radio port (0x180..0x1B8, 0..3) in Makefile.defs.

Type "make".


TEST
----

'make -C driver test' will detect and the receiver.

Include "linradio-toolkit-X.Y/driver" in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	cd examples
	./wrpanel.tcl
should display the graphical control panel.
You may need to delete ~/.wrstaterc and ~/.wrfreqdb if you have used
an incompatible version of wrpanel before.


INSTALL
-------

Add 'alias char-major-82 linradio' to /etc/conf.modules

Type "make install" as root.
