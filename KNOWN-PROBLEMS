- The module bypasses the serial driver. Therefore you must
  "rmmod serial" before loading linradio.o

- Volume state not initialized correctly with serial receivers

- Database entries may not contain '{' or '}'

- ~/.wrstaterc and ~/.wrfreqdb must be deleted by hand if corrupted.

- ~/.wr* not saved on control-c

- wrpanel: X11 focus lost after DB entry editing (with fvwm2)

- wrpanel: DB commands fail if no entry selected

- The kernel driver won't work with FPU emulation

- Floating-point in the kernel: FPU state is saved/restored when
  entering ioctls and rescheduling. Hopefully this is enough.
